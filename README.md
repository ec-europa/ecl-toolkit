# ECL Toolkit

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ec-europa/ecl-toolkit.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Set of tools we use to build our front-end components.

## Development

### Requirements

*   **Node.js LTS** (6.10.2) or more recent
*   **yarn stable** (v0.22.0) or more recent

### Initialization

```sh
yarn
```

This will install the main dependencies and automatically run `lerna bootstrap`.

### Examples

#### Basic

You **don't** need to install the dependencies here since lerna already took 
care of it during the [initialization](#initialization).

To get a basic fractal environment running with, just follow these steps:

```sh
cd examples/basic
yarn start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your fractal
app up and running.

For more information, you can check the [basic example's README](./examples/basic/README.md).

#### Other

_For now, there are no other examples available._
